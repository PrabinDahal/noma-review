They often shared the unhygienic living facilities in very close proximity with their domestic animals, e.g., sheep, goats, rams, donkeys, cows, and fowl. These communities had no access to a reliable supply of safe drinking water, and usually obtained water from contaminated, shallow wells. Facilities for safe disposal of human and animal fecal wastes were grossly inadequate. For oral hygiene care, the people relied almost exclusively on chewing sticks.
Quite often, the mothers cleaned the children’s mouths solely with fingers and water.
